The solution report consists of the jupyter notebook 'Ex02 Analysis.ipynb'.
You can read through it without running any code

Running the code is achieved by following these steps:

1) Compile code by issuing 'make all'. Be sure to change CXX to your compiler.
2) Generate correlation analysis data by issuing './correlation_analysis'
   This enables you to run all cells in part 1 of the notebook.
   You should first uncomment the data loading cell of part 1.
3) Generate data by issuing './main'
4) Analyze data by running all cells in 'Ex02 Analysis.ipynb'.
   You should uncomment the two data loading cells.

Note that running all the code takes some time, depending on your machine.
